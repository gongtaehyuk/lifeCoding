  <p>
    <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms 
    to the ECMAScript specification.[10] <span class="js">JavaScript</span>t is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
    and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based 
    object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside <span>HTML</span> and  <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World 
    Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] 
    often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] Most web browsers have a dedicated 
    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on the user's device.
    As a multi-paradigm language, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional, and 
    imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) 
    for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and 
    the Document Object Model (DOM).
    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, 
    storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system 
    provides <span class="js">JavaScript</span> APIs for I/O.
